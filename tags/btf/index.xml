To be upfront about it: This work is somewhat half-finished &amp;ndash; it already does something quite useful, but it could do a lot more, and it has not been evaluated thoroughly enough to be considered &amp;ldquo;production ready&amp;rdquo;. The reason I decided to publish it anyway is that I believe that there is an interesting opportunity to change the way in which we generate profiles for the analysis of Linux memory images &lt;em>in practice&lt;/em>. However, in order for it to become a production tool, at least one outstanding problem has to be addressed (I have some ideas on that one) and lots of coding work needs to be done &amp;ndash; and I simply do not have the resources to work on that right now.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
