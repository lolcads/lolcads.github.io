&lt;p>Cyber adversary emulation is an assessment method where tactis, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of real-world attackers are used to test the security controls of a system.
It helps to understand how an attacker might penetrate defenses, to evaluate installed security mechanisms and to improve the security posture by addressing identified weaknesses.
Furthermore, it allows running training scenarios for security professionals, e.g., in cyber ranges where practical exercises can be performed.
Unfortunately, adversary emulation requires significant time, effort, and specialized professionals to conduct.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
