This bug was classified as &amp;ldquo;Windows TCP/IP Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability&amp;rdquo;. The vulnerability itself was probably dormant for a long time, but became exploitable when the AF_UNIX address family was first introduced in 2019.
I will also take this as an excuse to explain in detail, what drivers are, how user space communicates with drivers, what a Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) is and what how we can achieve it in this case.</description></item></channel></rss>
