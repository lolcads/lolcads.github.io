The bug was discovered by Max Kellermann and described here. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the original publication yet, we&amp;rsquo;d suggest that you read it first (maybe also twice ;)). While Kellermann&amp;rsquo;s post is a great resource that contains all the relevant information to understand the bug, it assumes some familiarity with the Linux kernel. To fully understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on we&amp;rsquo;d like to shed some light on specific kernel internals.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting CVE-2021-43247</title><link>https://lolcads.github.io/posts/2022/06/exploiting_cve_2021_43247/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2022 10:59:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lolcads.github.io/posts/2022/06/exploiting_cve_2021_43247/</guid><description>In this blog post I will go in depth into the inner workings of CVE-2021-43247, which was fixed on the 14th of December 2021. This bug was classified as &amp;ldquo;Windows TCP/IP Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability&amp;rdquo;. The vulnerability itself was probably dormant for a long time, but became exploitable when the AF_UNIX address family was first introduced in 2019.
I will also take this as an excuse to explain in detail, what drivers are, how user space communicates with drivers, what a Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) is and what how we can achieve it in this case.</description></item></channel></rss>
