Well, here&amp;rsquo;s one, have a good look:
Upon receiving a command and control (C2) request, this specimen can execute arbitrary commands on the infected machine, exfiltrate sensitive files, perform passive and active network discovery scans (like nmap), or provide a privilege escalation backdoor to a local shell. Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s also trying its best to hide itself from system administrators hunting it with different command line tools such as ps, lsof, tcpdump an others or even try tools like rkhunter or chkrootkit.</description></item><item><title>Exploration of the Dirty Pipe Vulnerability (CVE-2022-0847)</title><link>https://lolcads.github.io/posts/2022/06/dirty_pipe_cve_2022_0847/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2022 19:57:03 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lolcads.github.io/posts/2022/06/dirty_pipe_cve_2022_0847/</guid><description>Intro This blog post reflects our exploration of the Dirty Pipe Vulnerability in the Linux kernel. The bug was discovered by Max Kellermann and described here. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the original publication yet, we&amp;rsquo;d suggest that you read it first (maybe also twice ;)). While Kellermann&amp;rsquo;s post is a great resource that contains all the relevant information to understand the bug, it assumes some familiarity with the Linux kernel. To fully understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on we&amp;rsquo;d like to shed some light on specific kernel internals.</description></item></channel></rss>
