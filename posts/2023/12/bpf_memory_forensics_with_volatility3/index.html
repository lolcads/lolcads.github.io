Well, here&rsquo;s one, have a good look:</p><p><div class=not-prose><figure><img src=/2023/12/ubuntu-20.04-LTS-focal-ebpfkit.png alt=ubuntu-20.04-LTS-focal-ebpfkit.png loading=lazy></figure></div></p><p>Upon receiving a command and control (C2) request, this specimen can execute arbitrary commands on the infected machine, exfiltrate sensitive files, perform passive and active network discovery scans (like <code>nmap</code>), or provide a privilege escalation backdoor to a local shell.

The news aren&rsquo;t that much the features, but rather how they are implemented. Everything is realized using a relatively new and rapidly evolving kernel feature: eBPF. Even though it has been in the kernel for almost 10 years now, we&rsquo;re regularly surprised by how many experienced Linux professionals are still unaware of its existence, not even to mention its potential for abuse.</p><p>The above picture was generated from the memory image of a system infected with <a href=https://github.com/Gui774ume/ebpfkit target=_blank rel=noopener><code>ebpfkit</code></a>
, an open-source PoC rootkit from 2021, using a plugin for the <a href=https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3 target=_blank rel=noopener>Volatility 3</a>
memory forensics framework. In this blog post, we will present a total of seven plugins that, taken together, facilitate an in depth analysis of the state of the BPF subsystem.</p><p>We structured this post as follows: The next section provides an introduction to the BPF subsystem, while the third section highlights its potential for (ab)use by malware. In section four, we will introduce seven Volatility 3 plugins that facilitate the examination of BPF malware. Section five presents a case study, followed by a section describing our testing and evaluation of the plugins on various Linux distributions.
In the last section, we conclude with a discussion of the steps that are necessary to integrate our work into the upstream Volatility project, other challenges we encountered, and open research questions.</p><p><em>Note: The words &ldquo;eBPF&rdquo; and &ldquo;BPF&rdquo; will be used interchangeably throughout this post.</em></p><h2 id=the-bpf-subsystem>The BPF Subsystem</h2><p>Before delving into the complexities of memory forensics, it is necessary to establish some basics about the BPF subsystem. Readers that are already familiar with the topic can safely skip this section.</p><p>To us, BPF is first of all an <strong>instruction set architecture (ISA)</strong>. It has ten general purpose registers, which are 64 bit wide, and there are all of the basic operations that you would expect a modern ISA to have. Its creator, Alexei Starovoitov, once described it as a kind of simplified x86-64 and would probably never have imagined that the ISA he cooked up back in 2014 would once enter a standardization process at the IETF. The interested reader can find the current proposed standard <a href=https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-bpf-isa/ target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>
. Of course, there are all the other things that you would expect to come with an ISA, like an ABI that defines the calling convention, and a binary encoding that maps instructions to sequences of four or eight bytes.</p><p>The BPF ISA is used as a compilation target (currently by clang - gcc support is on the way) for programs written in high-level languages (currently C and Rust), however, it is not meant to be implemented in hardware. Therefore, it is conceptually more similar to WebAssembly or Java Bytecode than x86-64 or arm64, i.e., BPF programs are meant to be executed by a <strong>runtime</strong> that implements the BPF virtual machine (VM). Several BPF runtimes exist, but the &ldquo;reference implementation” is in the Linux kernel.</p><p>Runtimes are, of course, free to choose how they implement the BPF VM. The instruction set was defined in a way that makes it easy to implement a one-to-one just in time (JIT) compiler for many CPU architectures. In fact, in the Linux kernel, even non-mainstream architectures like powerpc, sparc or s390 have BPF JITs. However, the kernel also has an <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.68/source/kernel/bpf/core.c#L1648 target=_blank rel=noopener>interpreter</a>
to run BPF programs on architectures that do not yet support JIT compilation.</p><p>Aside: <em>The BPF platform is what some call a &ldquo;<strong>verified</strong> target&rdquo;. This means that in order for a program to be valid it has to have some &ldquo;non-local&rdquo; properties. Those include the absence of (unbounded) loops, registers and memory can only be read after they have been written to, the stack depth may not exceed a hard limit, and many more. The interested reader can find a more exhaustive description <a href=https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/verifier.html target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>
. In practice, runtime implementations include an up-front static verification stage and refuse to execute programs that cannot be proven to meet these requirements (some runtime checks may be inserted to account for the known shortcomings of static analysis). This static verification approach is at the hearth of BPF&rsquo;s sandboxing model for untrusted code.</em></p><p>Roughly speaking, the BPF subsystem includes, besides the implementation of the BPF VM, a user and kernel space interface for managing the program life cycle as well as infrastructure for transitioning the kernel control flow in and out of programs running inside the VM. Other subsystems can be made &ldquo;programmable&rdquo; by integrating the BPF VM in places where they want to allow the calling of user-defined functions, e.g., for decision making based on their return value. The networking subsystem, for example, supports handing all incoming and outgoing packets on an interface to a BPF program. Those programs can freely rewrite the packet buffer or even decide to drop the packet all together. Another example is the tracing subsystem that supports transitioning control into BPF programs at essentially any instruction via one of the various ways it has to hook into the kernel and user space execution. The final example here is the Linux Security Module (LSM) subsystem that supports calling out to BPF programs at any of its security hooks placed at handpicked choke points in the kernel. There are many more examples of BPF usage in the kernel and even more in <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3609021 target=_blank rel=noopener>academic research papers</a>
and patches on the mailing list, but we guess we conveyed the general idea.</p><p>BPF programs can interact with the world outside of the VM via so called <strong>helpers</strong> or <strong>kfuncs</strong>, i.e., native kernel functions that can be called by BPF programs. Services provided by these functions range from getting a timestamp to sending a signal to the current task or reading arbitrary memory. Which functions a program can call depends on the <em>program type</em> that was selected when loading it into the VM. When reversing BPF programs, looking for calls to interesting kernel functions is a good point to start.</p><p>The second ingredient you need in order to get any real work done with a BPF program are <strong>maps</strong>. While programs can store data during their execution using stack memory or by allocating objects on the heap, the only way to persist data across executions of the same program are maps. Maps are mutable persistent key value stores that can be accessed by BPF programs and user space alike, as such they can be used for user-to-BPF, BPF-to-user, or BPF-to-BPF communication, where in the last case the communicating programs may be different or the same program at different times.</p><p>Another relevant aspect of the BPF ecosystem is the promise of <strong>compile once run everywhere (CORE)</strong>, i.e., a (compiled) BPF program can be run inside of a wide range of Linux kernels that might have different configurations, versions, compilers, and even CPU architectures. This is achieved by having the compiler emit special relocation entries that are processed by a user-space loader prior to loading a program into the kernel&rsquo;s BPF VM. The key ingredient that enables this approach is a self-description of the running kernel in the form of BPF Type Format (BTF) information, which is made available in special files under <code>/sys/kernel/btf/</code>. For example, BPF source code might do something like <code>current->comm</code> to access the name of the process in whose context the program is running. This might generate an assembly instruction that adds the offset of the <code>comm</code> field to a pointer to the task descriptor that is stored in a register, i.e., <code>ADD R5, IMM</code>. However, the immediate offset might vary due to kernel version, configuration, structure layout randomization or CPU architecture. Thus, the compiler would emit a relocation entry that tells the user-space loader running on the target system to check the kernel&rsquo;s BTF information in order to overwrite the placeholder with the correct offset. Together with other kinds of relocations, which address things like existence of types and enum variants or their sizes, the loader be used to run the same BPF program on a considerable number of kernels.</p><p>Aside: <em>A problem with the CORE implementation described above is that signatures over BPF programs are meaningless as the program text will be altered by relocations before loading. To allow for a meaningful ahead of time signature there is another approach in which a loader program is generated for the actual program. The loader program is portable without relocations and is signed and loaded together with the un-relocated bytecode of the actual program. Thus, the problem is solved as all text relocations happen in the kernel, i.e., after signatures have been verified.</em></p><p>However, there are of course limits to the portability of BPF programs. As we all know, the kernel takes great care to never break user space, within kernel land, on the other hand, there are no stability guarantees at all. BPF programs are not considered to be part of user space and thus there are no forward or backward compatibility guarantees. In practice, that means that APIs exposed to BPF could be removed or changed, attachment points could vanish or change their signature, or programs that are currently accepted by the static verifier could be rejected in the future. Furthermore, changes in kernel configuration could remove structure fields, functions, or kernel APIs that programs rely on. In that sense, BPF programs are in a position similar to out-of-tree kernel modules. That being said, due to CORE, there is no need to have the headers of the target kernel available at compile time and thus a lot less knowledge about the target is needed to be confident that the program will be able to run successfully. Furthermore, in the worst case the program will be rejected by the kernel, but there are no negative implications on system stability by attempting to load it.</p><p>Finally, we should mention that BPF is an entirely privileged interface. There are multiple BPF-related <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.68/source/include/uapi/linux/capability.h#L411 target=_blank rel=noopener>capabilities</a>
that a process can have, which open up various parts of the subsystem. This has not always been the case. A few years ago, unprivileged users were able to load certain types of BPF programs, however, access to the BPF VM comes with two potential security problems. First, the security entirely relies on the correctness of the static verification stage, which is notoriously complex and must keep up with the ever-expanding feature set. It has been demonstrated that errors in the verification process can be exploited for local privilege escalation, e.g., <a href=https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2020/4/8/cve-2020-8835-linux-kernel-privilege-escalation-via-improper-ebpf-program-verification target=_blank rel=noopener>CVE-2020-8835</a>
or <a href=https://chompie.rip/Blog+Posts/Kernel+Pwning+with+eBPF+-+a+Love+Story target=_blank rel=noopener>CVE-2021-3490</a>
. Second, even within the boundaries set by the verifier, the far-reaching control over the CPU instructions that get executed in kernel mode opens up the door for Spectre attacks, c.f., <a href=https://github.com/hamishcoleman/spectre-tests/blob/master/project-zero/writeup_files/WRITEUP#L282 target=_blank rel=noopener>Jann Horn&rsquo;s writeup</a>
or the original <a href=https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>Spectre paper</a>
. For those reasons, the kernel community has decided to remove unprivileged access to BPF <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.68/source/kernel/bpf/Kconfig#L71 target=_blank rel=noopener>by default</a>
.</p><h2 id=bpf-malware>BPF Malware</h2><p>To better understand the implications the addition of the BPF VM has for the Linux malware landscape, we would like to start with a quote from &ldquo;BPF inventor&rdquo; Alexei Starovoitov: &ldquo;If in the past the whole kernel would maybe be [a] hundred of programmers across the world, now a hundred thousand people around the world can program the kernel thanks to BPF.&rdquo;, i.e., BPF significantly lowers the entry barrier to kernel programming and shipping applications that include kernel-level code. While the majority of new kernel programmers are well-intentioned and aim to develop innovative and useful applications, experience has shown that there will be some actors who seek to use new kernel features for malicious purposes.</p><p>From a malware author&rsquo;s perspective, one of the first questions is probably how likely it is that a target system will support the loading of malicious BPF programs. According to our personal experience it is safe to say that most general-purpose desktop and server distributions enable BPF. The feature is also enabled in the <code>android-base.config</code> as BPF plays a significant role in the Android OS, i.e., essentially every Android device should support BPF - from your fridge to your phone. Concerning the custom kernels used by big tech companies let me quote Brendan Gregg, another early BPF advocate: &ldquo;As companies use more and more eBPF also, it becomes harder for your operating system to not have eBPF because you are no longer eligible to run workloads at Netflix or at Meta or at other companies.&rdquo;. What is more, Google relies on BPF (through <a href=https://github.com/cilium/cilium target=_blank rel=noopener><code>cilium</code></a>
) in its Kubernetes engine and Facebook uses it for its layer 4 load balancer <a href=https://github.com/facebookincubator/katran target=_blank rel=noopener><code>katran</code></a>
. For a more comprehensive survey of BPF usage in cloud environments we recommend section 5 of <a href=https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/he target=_blank rel=noopener><em>Cross Container Attacks: The Bewildered eBPF on Clouds</em></a>
by Yi He et al. Thus, most of the machines that constitute &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo; are likely to support BPF. This is particularly interesting as signature verification for BPF programs is still not available, making it the only way to run kernel code on locked-down systems that restrict the use of kernel modules.</p><p>However, enabling the BPF subsystem, i.e., <code>CONFIG_BPF</code>, is only the beginning of the story. There are many compile-time or run-time configuration choices that affect the capabilities granted to BPF programs, and thus the ways in which they can be used to subvert the security of a system. Giving a full overview of all the available switches and their effect would exceed the scope of this post, however, we will mention some knobs that can be turned to stop the abuses mentioned below.</p><p>If you search for the term “BPF malware” these days, you will find rather sensational articles with titles like &ldquo;eBPF: A new frontier for malware&rdquo;, &ldquo;How BPF-Enabled Malware Works&rdquo;, &ldquo;eBPF Offensive Capabilities – Get Ready for Next-gen Malware&rdquo;, &ldquo;Nothing is Safe Anymore - Beware of the “eBPF Trojan Horse” or &ldquo;HOW DOES EBPF MALWARE PERFORM AGAINST STAR LAB’S KEVLAR EMBEDDED SECURITY?&rdquo;. Needless to say, that they contain hardly any useful information. The truth is that we are not aware of any reports of in-the-wild malware using BPF. Nevertheless, there is no shortage in open source PoC BPF malwares on GitHub. The two biggest ones are probably <a href=https://github.com/Gui774ume/ebpfkit target=_blank rel=noopener>ebpfkit</a>
and <a href=https://github.com/h3xduck/TripleCross target=_blank rel=noopener>TripeCross</a>
, however, there are many smaller projects like <a href=https://github.com/eeriedusk/nysm target=_blank rel=noopener>nysm</a>
, <a href=https://github.com/Esonhugh/sshd_backdoor target=_blank rel=noopener>sshd_backdoor</a>
, <a href=https://github.com/krisnova/boopkit target=_blank rel=noopener>boopkit</a>
, <a href=https://github.com/citronneur/pamspy target=_blank rel=noopener>pamspy</a>
, or <a href=https://github.com/pathtofile/bad-bpf target=_blank rel=noopener>bad bpf</a>
as well as snippet collections like <a href=https://github.com/nccgroup/ebpf target=_blank rel=noopener>nccgroup&rsquo;s bpf tools</a>
, <a href=https://github.com/wunderwuzzi23/Offensive-BPF target=_blank rel=noopener>Offensive-BPF</a>
. Researchers also used malicious BPF programs to <a href=https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/he target=_blank rel=noopener>escape container isolation</a>
in multiple real-world cloud environments.</p><p>There are a couple of core shenanigans that those malwares are constructed around, three of which we will briefly describe here.</p><p>It is possible to transparently (for user space) skip the execution of any system call or to manipulate just the return value after it was executed. This is since BPF can be used for the purpose of <a href=https://lwn.net/Articles/740146/ target=_blank rel=noopener>error injection</a>
. To be precise, any function that is annotated with the <code>ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION</code> macro can be manipulated in this way, and every system call is <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.64/source/arch/x86/include/asm/syscall_wrapper.h#L74 target=_blank rel=noopener>automatically annotated</a>
via the macro that defines it. One would hope that the corresponding configurations <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.64/source/kernel/trace/Kconfig#L711 target=_blank rel=noopener><code>BPF_KPROBE_OVERRIDE</code></a>
and <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.67/source/lib/Kconfig.debug#L1880 target=_blank rel=noopener><code>CONFIG_FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION</code></a>
would not be enabled in kernels shipped to end users, but they are. There are many things that one can do by lying to user space in this way, one example would be to block the sending of all signals to a specific process, e.g., to protect it from being <a href=https://github.com/Gui774ume/ebpfkit/blob/5727985eab7eca7255ca5cb7c74133c0074e3324/ebpf/ebpfkit/signal.h#L18 target=_blank rel=noopener>killed</a>
. Interestingly, the same helper is also used by BPF-based security solutions like <a href="https://github.com/cilium/tetragon/blob/d8f5d44810ad2079ee408175454aab5c1159f09e/docs/content/en/docs/concepts/tracing-policy/selectors.md?plain=1#L1030" target=_blank rel=noopener>tetragon</a>
, which are deployed in production cloud environments.</p><p>Another common primitive is to write to memory of the current process, which gives attackers the power to perform all sorts of interesting memory corruptions. One of the more original ideas is to <a href=https://github.com/nccgroup/ebpf/tree/master/glibcpwn target=_blank rel=noopener>inject code</a>
into a process by writing a ROP chain onto its stack. The chain sets up everything to load a shared library and cleanly resumes the process afterwards. More generally, the helper <code>bpf_probe_write_user</code> is involved in many techniques to hide objects, e.g., sockets or BPF programs, from user space or when manipulating apparent file and directory contents, e.g., <code>/proc</code>, <code>/etc/sudoers</code> or <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>. In particular, those apparent modifications cannot be caught with file system forensics as they are only happening in the memory of the process that attempts to access the resource, e.g., see <a href=https://github.com/pathtofile/bad-bpf/blob/main/src/textreplace.bpf.c target=_blank rel=noopener><code>textreplace</code></a>
for an example that allows arbitrary apparent modifications of file contents. While there are in fact a couple of legitimate programs (like the <a href=https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/f425dfa882dd9ca8533172c246ea047be1a40799/pkg/security/ebpf/probes/all.go#L257 target=_blank rel=noopener>Datadog-agent</a>
) using this function, it is probably wise to enable <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.67/source/security/lockdown/Kconfig#L33 target=_blank rel=noopener><code>CONFIG_LOCK_DOWN_KERNEL_FORCE_INTEGRITY</code></a>
before compilation.</p><p>A rather peculiar aspect of BPF malware is how it communicates over the network. BPF programs are not able to initiate network connections by themselves, but as one of the main applications of BPF is in the networking subsystem, they have far-reaching capabilities when it comes to managing existing traffic. For example, XDP programs get their hands on packets very early in the receive path, long before mechanisms like netfilter, which is much further up the network stack, get a chance to see them. In fact, there are high-end NICs that support <a href=https://www.netronome.com/blog/ever-deeper-bpf-update-hardware-offload-support/ target=_blank rel=noopener>running BPF programs on the device&rsquo;s proces</a>
rather than the host CPU. Furthermore, programs that handle packets can usually modify, reroute, or drop them. In combination, this is often used to receive C2 commands while at the same time hiding the corresponding packets from the rest of the kernel by modifying or dropping them. In addition, BPF&rsquo;s easy programmability makes it simple to implement complex, stateful triggers. To exfiltrate data from the system, the contents, and potentially also the recipient data, of outgoing packets are modified, for example by traffic control (tc) hooks. For unreliable transport protocols higher layers will deal with the induced packet loss, while for TCP the retransmission mechanism ensures that applications will not be impacted. Turn off <a href="https://www.kernelconfig.io/CONFIG_NET_CLS_BPF?q=NET_CLS_BPF&amp;kernelversion=6.6.6&amp;arch=x86" target=_blank rel=noopener><code>CONFIG_NET_CLS_BPF</code></a>
and <a href="https://www.kernelconfig.io/CONFIG_NET_ACT_BPF?q=CONFIG_NET_ACT_BPF&amp;kernelversion=6.6.6&amp;arch=x86" target=_blank rel=noopener><code>CONFIG_NET_ACT_BPF</code></a>
to disable tc BPF programs.</p><p>While the currently charted BPF malware landscape is limited to hobby projects by security researchers and other interested individuals, it would unfortunately not be unheard of that the same projects are eventually discovered during real-world incidents. Advanced Linux malwares, on the other hand, will most likely choose to implement their own BPF programs when they believe that it is beneficial for their cause, for instance to avoid detection by using a mechanism that is not yet well known to the forensic community. Some excerpts from the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BDB53PqcoU" target=_blank rel=noopener>talk by Kris Nova at DevOpsDays Kyiv</a>
give an interesting insight into the concerns that the Ukrainian computer security community had, and still has, regarding the use of BPF in Russian attacks on their systems.</p><p>It would be dishonest to claim that there is a general schema that you can follow while analyzing an incident to discover all malicious BPF programs. As so often, the boundaries between monitoring software, live patches, security solutions and malware are not clearly defined, e.g., in addition to <code>bpf_override_retun</code> <a href=https://github.com/cilium/tetragon target=_blank rel=noopener>tetragon</a>
also uses <code>bpf_send_singal</code>. The first step could be to obtain a baseline of expected BPF-related activity, and carefully analyze any deviations or anomalies. Additionally, a look at the kernel configuration can help to decide which kinds of malicious activity are fundamentally possible. Furthermore, programs that make use of possibly malicious helper functions, like <code>bpf_probe_wite_user</code>, <code>bpf_send_signal</code>, <code>bpf_override_return</code>, or <code>bpf_skb_store_bytes</code> should be <a href=https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/12/reverse-engineering-ebpfkit-rootkit-with-blackberrys-free-ida-processor-tool target=_blank rel=noopener>reverse engineered</a>
with particular scrutiny. In addition, there are some clear indicators of malicious activity, like the hiding of programs, which we will discuss in more detail below. Finally, once program signatures are upstreamed, it is highly recommended to enable and enforce them to lock down this attack surface.</p><p>From now on, we will shift gears and focus on the main topic of this post, hunting BPF malware in main memory images.</p><p><em>Aside: The <a href=https://www.pangulab.cn/en/post/the_bvp47_a_top-tier_backdoor_of_us_nsa_equation_group/ target=_blank rel=noopener>bvp47</a>

rootkits are often said to be examples of BPF malware. However, they are using only what is now known as classic BPF, i.e., the old-school packet filtering programs used by programs like tcpdump.</em></p><h2 id=volatility-plugins>Volatility Plugins</h2><p>Volatility is a <strong>memory forensics framework</strong> that can be used to analyze physical memory images. It uses information about symbols and types of the operating system that was running on the imaged system to recover high-level information, like the list of running processes or open files, from the raw memory image.</p><p>Individual analyses are implemented as <strong>plugins</strong> that make use of the framework library as well as other plugins. Some of those plugins are closely modeled after core unix utilities, like the <code>ps</code> utility for listing processes, the <code>ss</code> utility for listing network connections or the <code>lsmod</code> utility for listing kernel modules. Other plugins implement checks that search for common traces of kernel rootkit activity, like the replacement of function pointers or inline hooks.</p><p>There may be multiple ways to obtain the same piece of information, and thus multiple plugins that, on first sight, serve the same purpose. <strong>Inconsistencies</strong> between the methods, however, could indicate malicious activity that tries to hide its presence or just be artifacts of imperfections in the acquisition process. In any case, inconsistencies are something an investigator should look into.</p><p>In this section we present seven Volatility plugins that we have developed to enable analysis of the BPF subsystem. Three of these are modelled after subcommands of the <a href=https://github.com/libbpf/bpftool target=_blank rel=noopener><code>bpftool</code></a>
utility and provide basic functionality. We then present three plugins that retrieve similar information from other sources and can thus be used to detect inconsistencies. Finally, we present a plugin that aggregates information from four other plugins to make it easier to interpret.</p><p>_Note: We published the source code for all of our plugins on <a href=https://github.com/vobst/BPFVol3 target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub</a>

We would love to see your contributions there! :)</p><h3 id=listing-programs-maps--links>Listing Programs, Maps & Links</h3><p>Arguably the most basic task that you could think of is simply listing the programs that have been loaded into the BPF VM. We will start by doing this on a live system, feel free to follow along in order to discover what your distribution or additional packages that you installed have already loaded.</p><h4 id=live-system>Live System</h4><p>The <code>bpftool</code> user-space utility allows admins to interact with the BPF subsystem.

We will now introduce three plugins that aim to make this possible.</p><p>We already saw that all sorts of BPF objects are identified by an ID.

This is useful as a unique identifier of the structure.</li><li><code>LOADED AT</code> is the number of nanoseconds since boot when the program was loaded. Converting it to an absolute timestamp requires parsing additional kernel time-keeping structures and is not in scope for this plugin. There exist Volatility patches that add this functionality but they are not upstream yet. Once they are, it should be trivial to convert this field to match the <code>bpftool</code> output.</li><li><code>HELPERS</code> is a field that is not reported by <code>bpftool</code>. It displays a list of all the kernel functions that are called by the BPF program, i.e., BPF helpers and kfuncs, and is helpful to quickly identify programs that use possibly malicious or non-standard helpers.</li><li>The reporting of memory utilization is omitted as we consider it to be less important for forensic investigations, however, it would be easy to add.</li></ul><p>The second <code>bpftool</code> functionality the plugin supports is the dumping of programs in bytecode and jited forms. To dump the machine code of the program, we follow the <code>bpf_func</code> pointer in the <code>bpf_prog</code> structure, which points to the entrypoint of the jited BPF program. The length of the machine code is stored in the <code>jited_len</code> field of the same structure. While we support dumping the raw bytes to a file, their analysis is tedious due to missing symbol information. Thus, we also support disassembling the program and annotating all occurring addresses with the corresponding symbol, which makes the programs much easier to analyze.</p><p>Dumping the BPF bytecode is straightforward as well. The flexible <code>insni</code> array member of the <code>bpf_prog</code> structure holds the bytecode instructions and the <code>len</code> field holds their number. Here, we also support dumping the raw and disassembled bytecode. However, the additional symbol annotations are not implemented. As the bytecode is not &ldquo;what actually runs&rdquo;, we consider this information more susceptible to anti-forensic tampering and thus focused on the machine code, which is what is executed when invoking the program.</p><p><em>Note: We use <a href=https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone target=_blank rel=noopener>Capstone</a>
for disassembling the BPF bytecode. Unfortunately, Capstone&rsquo;s BPF architecture is outdated and thus bytecode is sometimes not disassembled entirely. As a workaround, you can dump the raw bytes and use another tool to disassemble them.</em></p><p>Entries of the <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.63/source/kernel/bpf/syscall.c#L52 target=_blank rel=noopener><code>map_idr</code></a>

However, the entire ID mechanism is in the user-facing part of the BPF subsystem, its simply a means for user space to refer to BPF objects in syscalls. Thus, our plugins are susceptible to trivial anti-forensic tampering.</p><p>In our research, we prototyped two anti-forensic methods that remove BPF objects from these structures while still keeping the corresponding program active in the kernel. First, the more straightforward way is to simply write a kernel module that uses standard APIs to remove IDs from the IDRs. The second one is based on the observation that the lifecycle of BPF objects is managed via reference counts. Thus, if we artificially increment the reference count of an object that (indirectly) holds references to all other objects that are required to operate a BPF program, e.g., a link, we can prevent the program&rsquo;s destruction when all &ldquo;regular&rdquo; references are dropped.</p><p>One approach to counter these anti-forensic measures is to &ldquo;approach from the other side&rdquo;. Instead of relying on information from sources that are far detached from the actual program execution, we go to the very places and mechanisms that invoke the program. The downside is obviously that this low-level code is much more program-type and architecture specific, the results, on the other hand, are more robust.</p><p>In a <a href=https://blog.eb9f.de/2023/04/24/lsm2bpf.html target=_blank rel=noopener>previous blog post</a>
we described the low-level details that lead up to the execution of BPF LSM programs in great detail. Based on this knowledge, we developed the <a href=https://github.com/vobst/BPFVol3/blob/main/src/plugins/bpf_lsm.py target=_blank rel=noopener><code>bpf_lsm</code></a>
plugin that can discover hidden BPF programs attached to security hooks. In short, the plugin checks the places where the kernel control flow may be diverted into the BPF VM for the presence of inline hooks. If they are found, it cross checks with the links IDR to see if there is a corresponding link, the absence of which is a strong indication of tampering. Additionally, the plugin is also valuable in the absence of tampering, as it shows you the exact program attachment point without the need to manually resolve BTF IDs. In particular, the plugin displays the number of attached programs and their IDs along with the name of the LSM hook where they are attached.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=display:flex><span>columns: list[tuple[str, type]] <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> [

Thus, the second plugin that obtains its information from more tamper resistant sources targets tc BPF programs. It only relies on the <a href=https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.65/source/include/net/sch_generic.h#L1265 target=_blank rel=noopener><code>mini_Qdisc</code></a>
structure that is used on the transmission and receive fast paths to look up queuing disciplines (qdisc) attached to a network device.</p><p>We use the <a href=https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/community3/blob/master/Sheffer_Shaked_Docker/plugins/ifconfig.py target=_blank rel=noopener><code>ifconfig plugin</code></a>

Then, we find the above-mentioned structure and use it to collect all BPF programs that are involved into qdiscs on this device. With kernel 6.3 the process of locating the <code>mini_Qdisc</code> from the network interface changed slightly due to the introduction of link-based attachment of tc programs, however, the plugin recognizes and handles both cases.

plugin, a meta analysis that we have build on top of the four listing plugins. As its name suggest, its goal is to visualize the state of the BPF subsystem as a graph.</p><p>There are four types of nodes in this graph: programs, maps, links and processes. Different node types are distinguished by shape. Within a node type, the different program/map/link types are distinguished by color and process nodes are colored based on their process ID (PID). Furthermore, map and program nodes are labeled with the ID and name of the object, link nodes are labeled with the ID and attachment information of the link, and process nodes receive the PID and comm (name of the user-space program binary) of their process as labels.</p><p>There are three types of edges to establish relationships between nodes: file descriptor, link, and map. File descriptor edges are dotted and connect processes to BPF objects that they have an open fd for. Link edges are dashed and connect BPF links to the program they reference. Finally, map edges are drawn solid and connect maps to all of the programs that use them.</p><p>Especially for large applications with hundreds or even thousands of objects, it is essential to be able to filter the graph to make it useful. We have therefore implemented two additional options that can be passed to the plugin. First, you can pass a list of node types to include in the output. Second, you can pass a list of nodes, and only the connected components that contain at least one of those nodes will be drawn.</p><p>The idea of this plugin is to make the information of the four listing plugins more accessible to investigators by combining it into a single picture. This is especially useful for complex applications with possibly hundreds of programs and maps, or on busy systems where many different processes have loaded BPF programs.</p><p>Plugin output comes in two forms, a dot-format encoding of the graph, where each BPF object node has metadata containing all of the plugin columns, and as a picture of the graph, drawn with a default layout algorithm. The latter should suffice for most users, but the former allows advanced use-cases to do further processing.</p><p><em>Note: We provide <a href=https://github.com/vobst/BPFVol3/tree/main/docs target=_blank rel=noopener>standalone documentation</a>

</code></pre><p>The first lesson here is probably that symbol annotations are useful :). As expected, when ignoring the prologue and epilogue inserted by the JIT-compiler, the translation between BPF and x86_64 is essentially one-to-one. Furthermore, uses of global C variables like <code>my_pid</code> or the format string result in direct references to kernel memory, where the closest preceding symbols are the <code>minimal_.bss</code>&rsquo;s and <code>minimal_.rodata</code>&rsquo;s <code>bpf_map</code> structures, respectively. For simple array maps, the <code>bpf_map</code> structure resides at the beginning of a buffer that also holds the array data, <code>0x110</code> is simply the offset at which the map&rsquo;s payload data starts. More generally, libbpf will automatically create maps to hold the variables living in the <code>.data</code>, <code>.rodata</code>, and <code>.bss</code> sections.</p><p>Dumping the map contents confirms that the <code>.bss</code> map holds the <code>minimal</code> process&rsquo;s PID while the <code>.rodata</code> map contains the format string.</p><pre tabindex=0><code># vol -f /io/dumps/debian-bookworm-6.1.0-13-amd64_all.raw linux.bpf_listmaps --id 45 40 --dump

To ensure the correctness of all plugin results, we have cross-checked them by debugging the guest kernel as well as comparing them with <code>bpftool</code> running on the guest.</p><p>Below is a list of the distributions and releases that we used for manual testing</p><p><strong>Debian</strong></p><ul><li>12.2.0-14, Linux 6.1.0-13</li></ul><p><strong>Ubuntu</strong></p><ul><li>22.04.2, Linux 5.15.0-89-generic</li><li>20.04, Linux 5.4.0-26-generic</li></ul><p><strong>Custom</strong></p><ul><li>Linux 6.0.12, various configurations</li><li>Linux 6.2.12, various configurations</li></ul><p>For each of these kernels, we tested at least all the plugins on an image taken during the execution of the libbpf-bootstrap example programs.</p><p>Additionally, to the above mentioned kernels we also developed an evaluation framework (the code is not public). The framework is based on <a href=https://www.vagrantup.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Vagrant</a>
and <a href=https://libvirt.org/ target=_blank rel=noopener>libvirt</a>
/<a href=https://linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page target=_blank rel=noopener>KVM</a>
. First we create and update all VMs. After that we run programs from <code>libbpf-bootstrap</code> with <code>nohup</code> so that we can leave the VM and dump the memory from outside. To dump the memory we use <code>virsh</code> with <code>virsh dump &lt;name of VM> --memory-only</code>. <code>virsh dump</code> pauses the VM for a clean acquisition of the main memory. We also install debug symbols for all the Linux distributions under investigation so that we can gather the debug kernels (<code>vmlinux</code> with DWARF debugging information) and the <code>System.map</code> file. We then use both files with <a href=https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/dwarf2json target=_blank rel=noopener><code>dwarf2json</code></a>
to generate the ISF information that Volatility 3 needs. Currently, we tested the following Linux distributions with their respective kernels:</p><ul><li>Alma Linux 9 - Linux kernel 5.14.0-362.8.1.el9_3.x86_64 ✅</li><li>Fedora 38 - Linux kernel 6.6.6-100.fc38.x86_64 ✅</li><li>Fedora 39 - Linux kernel 6.6.6-200.fc39.x86_64 ✅</li><li>CentOS Stream 9 - Linux kernel 5.14.0-391.el9.x86_64 ✅</li><li>Rocky Linux 8 - Linux kernel 4.18.0-513.9.1.el8_9.x86_64 ✅</li><li>Rocky Linux 9 - 🪲 <code>kernel-debuginfo-common</code> package is missing so the kernel debugging symbols cannot be installed (<a href=https://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/BaseOS/x86_64/debug/tree/Packages/k/ target=_blank rel=noopener>list of packages</a>

)</li><li>openSUSE Tumbleweed - ❓ it seems that the debug kernel that is provided by OpenSUSE <em>does</em> contain debugging symbols but other sections such as <code>.rodata</code> are removed (zeroed out) so that <code>dwarf2json</code> is not able to find the banner (further analyses cannot be carried out without this information) - we will further investigate this issue</li></ul><p>We will check if the problems get resolved and re-evaluate our plugin. Generally, our framework is designed to support more distributions as well and we will try to evaluate the plugin on a wider variety of them.</p><p>During our automated analysis we encountered an interesting problem. To collect the kernels with debugging symbols from the VMs we need to copy them to the host. When copying the kernel executable file it will be read into main memory by the kernel&rsquo;s page-cache mechanism. This implies that parts of the kernel file (vmlinux) and the kernel itself (the running kernel not the file) may be present in the dump. This can lead to the problem of the Volatility 3 function <code>find_aslr</code> (<a href=https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3/blob/fdf93f502fa8d0edc2b60764463aee3c455aeb03/volatility3/framework/automagic/linux.py#L121 target=_blank rel=noopener>source code</a>

.</p><h2 id=related-work>Related Work</h2><p>There are several articles on BPF that cover different security-related aspects of the subsystem. In this section, we will briefly discuss the ones that are most relevant to the presented work.</p><p><strong>Memory Forensics</strong>: The <a href=https://github.com/crash-utility/crash/tree/master target=_blank rel=noopener><code>crash</code></a>
utility, which is used to analyze live systems or kernel core dumps, has a <a href=https://github.com/crash-utility/crash/blob/master/bpf.c target=_blank rel=noopener><code>bpf</code> subcommand</a>
that can be used to display information about BPF maps and programs. However, as it is not a forensics tool it relies solely on the information obtained via the <code>prog_idr</code> and <code>map_ird</code>. Similarly, the <a href=https://github.com/osandov/drgn target=_blank rel=noopener><code>drgn</code></a>
programmable debugger comes with a <a href=https://github.com/osandov/drgn/blob/main/tools/bpf_inspect.py target=_blank rel=noopener>script</a>
to list BPF programs and maps but suffers from the same problems when it comes to anti-forensic techniques. Furthermore, <code>drgn</code> and <code>crash</code> are primarily known as debugging tools for systems developers and as such not necessarily well-established in the digital forensics and incidence response (DFIR) community. In contrast, we implemented our analyses as plugins for the popular Volatility framework well-known in the DFIR community. Finally, A. Case and G. Richard presented Volatility plugins for investigating the Linux tracing infrastructure in their <a href=https://i.blackhat.com/USA21/Wednesday-Handouts/us-21-Fixing-A-Memory-Forensics-Blind-Spot-Linux-Kernel-Tracing-wp.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>BlackHat US 2021 paper</a>
. Apart from a plugin that lists programs by parsing the <code>prog_idr</code>, they have also implemented several plugins that can find BPF programs by analyzing the data structures of the attachment mechanisms they use, such as kprobes, tracepoints or perf events. Thus, their plugins are also able to discover inconsistencies that could reveal anti-forensic tampering. However, they have never publicly released their plugins and despite several attempts we have been unable to contact the authors to obtain a copy of the source code. Volatility already supports detecting BPF programs attached to sockets in its <a href=https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3/blame/develop/volatility3/framework/plugins/linux/sockstat.py#L163 target=_blank rel=noopener><code>sockstat</code></a>
plugin. The displayed information is limited to names and IDs.</p><p><strong>Reverse Engineering</strong>: Reverse engineering BPF programs is a key step while triaging the findings of our plugins. Recently, the <a href=https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra target=_blank rel=noopener>Ghidra</a>
software reverse engineering (SRE) suite gained <a href=https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/pull/4258 target=_blank rel=noopener>support for the BPF architecture</a>
, which means that its powerful decompiler can be used to analyze BPF bytecode extracted from kernel memory or user-space programs. Furthermore, BPF bytecode is oftentimes embedded into user-space programs that use framework libraries to load it into the kernel at runtime. For programs written in the Go programming language, <a href=https://github.com/Gui774ume/ebpfkit-monitor target=_blank rel=noopener>ebpfkit-monitor</a>
can parse the binary format of these embedded files to list the defined programs and maps as well as their interactions. It uses this information to generate graphs that are similar to those of our <code>bpf_graph</code> plugin. Although the utility of these graphs has inspired our plugin, it is fundamentally different in that it displays information about the state of the kernel&rsquo;s BPF subsystem extracted from a memory image. Consequently, it is inherently agnostic to the user-space framework that was used for compiling and loading the programs. Additionally, it displays the actual state of the BPF subsystem instead of the BPF objects that might be created by an executable at runtime.</p><p><strong>Runtime Protection and Monitoring</strong>: Important aspects of countering BPF malware are preventing attackers from loading malicious BPF programs and logging suspicious events for later review. <a href=https://github.com/Gui774ume/krie target=_blank rel=noopener>krie</a>
and <a href=https://github.com/Gui774ume/ebpfkit-monitor target=_blank rel=noopener>ebpfkit-monitor</a>
are tools that can be used to log BPF-related events as well as to deny processes access to the BPF system call.</p><p>Simply blocking access on a per-process basis is too course-grained for many applications and thus <a href=https://medium.com/@yunwei356/the-secure-path-forward-for-ebpf-runtime-challenges-and-innovations-968f9d71fc16 target=_blank rel=noopener>multiple approaches were proposed</a>
to implement a more fine-grained access control model for the BPF subsystem to facilitate the realization of least privilege policies. Among those, one can further distinguish between proposals that implement access control in user space, kernel space, or a hypervisor.</p><p><a href=https://bpfman.io/main/ target=_blank rel=noopener><code>bpfman</code></a>
(formerly known as bpfd) is a privileged user space daemon that acts as proxy for loading BPF programs and can be used to implement different access control policies. A combination of a privileged user-space daemon and kernel changes is used in the proposed <a href=https://lwn.net/Articles/947173/ target=_blank rel=noopener>BPF token approach</a>
that allows delegation of access to specific parts of the BPF subsystem to container processes by a privileged daemon.</p><p>A fine-grained in-kernel access control is offered by the <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3620237.3620571 target=_blank rel=noopener>CapBits</a>
proposed by Yi He et al. Here, two bitfields are added to the <code>task_struct</code>, where one defines the access that a process has to the BPF subsystem, e.g., allowed program types and helpers, and the other restricts the access that BPF programs can have on the process, e.g., to prevent it from being traced by kprobe programs. Namespaces are already used in many areas of the Linux kernel to virtualize global resources like PIDs or network devices. Thus, Y. <a href=https://lwn.net/Articles/927354/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Shao proposed introducing BPF namespaces</a>
to limit the scope of loaded programs to processes inside of the namespace. Finally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9p4qviq60z8" target=_blank rel=noopener>signatures over programs</a>
are a mechanism that allows the kernel to verify their provenance, which can be used analogous to module signatures that prevent attackers from loading malicious kernel modules.</p><p>Lastly, Y. Wang et al. <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3609021.3609305 target=_blank rel=noopener>proposed</a>
moving large parts of the BPF VM from the kernel into a hypervisor, where they implement a multi-step verification process that includes enforcing a security policy, checking signatures, and scanning for known malicious programs. In the security policy, allowed programs can be specified as a set of deterministic finite automata, which allows for accepting dynamically generated programs without allowing for arbitrary code to be loaded.</p><p>All these approaches are complementary to our plugins as they focus on reducing the chance that an attacker can successfully load a malicious program, while we assume that this step has already happened and aim to detect their presence.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>In this post, we gave an introduction to the Linux BPF subsystem and discussed its potential for abuse. We then presented seven Volatility plugins that allow investigators to detect BPF malware in memory images and evaluated them on multiple versions of popular Linux distributions. To conclude the post, we will briefly discuss related projects we are working on and plans for future work.</p><p>This project grew out of the preparation of a <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20230323233100/https://dfrws.org/forensic-analysis-of-ebpf-based-linux-rootkits/ target=_blank rel=noopener>workshop</a>
on BPF rootkits at the DFRWS EU 2023 annual conference (<a href=https://github.com/fkie-cad/bpf-rootkit-workshop target=_blank rel=noopener>materials</a>
). We began working on this topic because we believe that the forensic community needs to expand its toolbox in response to the rise of BPF in the Linux world to fill blind spots in existing analysis methods. Additionally, investigators who may encounter BPF in their work should be made aware of the potential relevance of the subsystem to their investigation.</p><p>While the workshop, our plugins, and this post are an important step towards this goal, much work remains to be done. First, in order for the present work to be useful in the real world our next goal must be to upstream most of it into the Volatility 3 project. Only this will ensure that investigators all around the world will be able to easily find and use it. This will require:</p><ul><li>Refactoring of our utility code to use Volatility 3&rsquo;s extension class mechanism</li><li>The <code>bpf_graph</code> plugin relies on <a href=https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/index.html target=_blank rel=noopener>networkx</a>
, which is not yet a dependency of Volatility 3. If the introduction of a new dependency into the upstream project is not feasible, one could make it optional by checking for the presence of the package within the plugin.</li><li>Additional testing on older kernel versions and kernels with diverse configurations to meet Volatility&rsquo;s high standards regarding compatibility</li></ul><p>We will be happy to work with upstream developers to make the integration happen.</p><p>Furthermore, there remains the problem of dealing with the wide variety of map types when extracting their contents, as well as the related problem of pretty-printing them using BTF information. Here, we consider a manual implementation approach to be impractical and would explore the possibility of using emulation of the relevant functions.</p><p>Regarding the advanced analysis aimed at countering anti-forensics, we have also implemented consistency checks against the lists of kprobes and tracepoints, but these require further work to be ready for publication. We also described additional analyses in our workshop that still need to be implemented.</p><p>Finally, an interesting side effect of the introduction of BPF into the Linux kernel is that most of the functionality requires BTF information for the kernel and modules to be available. This provides an easy solution to the problem of obtaining type information from a raw memory image, a step that is central to automatic profile generation. We have already shown that it is possible to reliably extract BTF sections from memory images by implementing a <a href=https://github.com/vobst/BPFVol3/blob/extractbtf/src/plugins/btf_extract.py target=_blank rel=noopener>plugin</a>
for that. We have also explored the possibility of combining this with existing approaches for extracting symbol information in order to obtain working profiles from a dump. While the results are promising, further work is needed to have a usable solution.</p><h2 id=appendix>Appendix</h2><h3 id=a-kernel-configuration>A: Kernel Configuration</h3><p>This section provides a list of compile-time kernel configuration options that can be adjusted to restrict the capabilities of BPF programs.
